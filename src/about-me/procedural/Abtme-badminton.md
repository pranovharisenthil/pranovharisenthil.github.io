summary: Most people know I’m not a huge fan of sports; it’s just not my thing. The only exception? Badminton. It’s a (relatively) simple game to learn, but really hard to master, punishing even the smallest mistakes. What hooked me even more, though, is that my parents play too, whcch meant a great excuse to spend time with them. That’s why I love it :D
