summary: "Kollywood is the pride of Tamil Nadu (pissed of some people there) and the pride of my heart. Sure, some moments are pure cringe, but when Rajini does his iconic walk, I canâ€™t help but whistle. And even when the songs feel unnecessary, I canâ€™t help but vibe with them. To me, Kollywood isnâ€™t interesting because it tells groundbreaking stories; itâ€™s interesting because it lets me connect with my roots while having an absolute blast. Though the movies still suck :( (Coolie was supposed to be great but it wasn't ðŸ˜­)"
