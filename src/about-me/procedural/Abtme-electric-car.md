summary: "I didn’t fall in love with electric car right away. It started with a “sure, I’ll help,” and somehow turned into screwing plates in at 10pm, and calling it “fun.” I realized this wasn’t just a club, it was a spark (pun fully intended). Electric car made me see how engineering is equal parts chaos, caffeine, and creativity; and honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way."
