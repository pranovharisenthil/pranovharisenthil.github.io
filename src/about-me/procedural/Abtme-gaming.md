summary: "My first game was Angry Birds when I was three (an iconic start, I’d say). But the game I’ve spent the most time on? Minecraft. It’s impossible to get bored when there's so much to do that even now I'm learning new things whenever I play. As is with life, it came around and I could no longer do 8 hour gaming sessions. But yet again my gamer found a way: my favorite game, Polytopia. The strategist in me can’t resist it; it’s smart, quick, and surprisingly deep. It scratches that perfect strategy itch without demanding a full-time commitment. On your left is Planning from a Polytopia Game I played Recently."
