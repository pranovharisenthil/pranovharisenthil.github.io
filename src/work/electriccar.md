summary: 'As a Tinkerer, I am obligated to love a club where you can BUILD A CAR FORM SCRATCH! I''m mainly involved in the 3D Printing, Race Strategy and Technical Innovation departmetns, as I feel it''s what suits me best. I do dip my fingers in the other departments, just so I am aware of everything - mainly the Mechanical and Electrical departments.'
